# Module 9 Challenge

This is my submission for the Module 9 challenge of the UCI Bootcamp. 

Data Modeling
I used https://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com/ to create an entity relationship diagram based on the csv files provided (departments, dept_emp, dept_manager, employees, salaries, titles)

Data Engineering
I exported the entity relationship diagram to PostgreSQL using the same link. I made a few changes such as adding the DROP TABLE IF EXISTS functions. This can be found in the Table_schemata.sql file.

Data Analysis
From the data provided, I created specific tables using SQL based on the list provided. This can be found in the queries.sql file.
